# Cronoss Powershell Password Generator
This is a nice powershell script to generate a password based on a Hash of a user inputed string.

## Functionality
This script could be used for any type of server administration, complex user passwords, or you just don't trust those Third party password generators that store the passwords.

With that being said, this script does not store any values, such as key words being used to generate the password.

## Reason for PowerShell vs any other language
This script was inspired by a different Password Algorithm, but still able to run in PowerShell. 

It was also meant to be an alternative to any third-party program that would need to be installed on the networked enclave.

Given that these third-party programs have a means to be hacked, this script provides a nice alternative.

This script can be used to change the password of Local System admin passwords, user passwords, or what is needed, just based on things such as a Customer Name, Computer name, or even serial number.

This allows for more security, because it would be a tool to translate the password from plain-text key words mentioned before into a complex password to be used in these cases.
