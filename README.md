# SCCM/MECM Automated Idenitifcation Script.
The intent behind this script is to be able to have machines call this upon login, and self-identify what problems it has when it comes to SCCM/MECM.

This can be extremely useful when the machine has no user input for updating the software that is installed, and requires organizational updates.
